# AES-Chat

Simple chat client/server to create an E2E encrypted chat using RSA (key-exchange) and AES (message-encryption).
I do not support and maintain this code anymore and **i cannot ensure that this encryption is safe**.

The project was created as a fun project and should only be used for educational purposes.
